To set C and C++ compilers for a project, the steps can vary depending on the development environment or IDE you are using. 
Below are general instructions for some popular IDEs and environments.

### 1. **Using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Command Line**

If you are using the command line with GCC, you can compile your C and C++ files as follows:

- **For C:**
  ```bash
  gcc -o my_program my_program.c
  ```

- **For C++:**
  ```bash
  g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp
  ```

### 2. **Visual Studio (Windows)**

1. **Open your project** in Visual Studio.
2. **Right-click on your project** in the Solution Explorer.
3. **Select "Properties."**
4. **Under "Configuration Properties,"** go to "C/C++" for C settings or "Linker" for linking settings.
5. **Set the appropriate compiler options** in the "Command Line" or other relevant sections.
6. **For C++ projects,** ensure that the "Configuration Type" is set to "Application (.exe)" and that the "C++ Compiler" is selected.

### 3. **Code::Blocks**

1. **Open Code::Blocks.**
2. **Go to "Settings" > "Compiler."**
3. **Select the compiler** you want to use from the dropdown (e.g., GNU GCC Compiler).
4. **You can set the compiler options** under the "Other options" tab.
5. **To create a new project,** go to "File" > "New" > "Project," and select either a C or C++ project.

### 4. **Eclipse CDT**

1. **Open Eclipse.**
2. **Select "File" > "New" > "C/C++ Project."**
3. **Choose the project type** (C Project or C++ Project).
4. **Select the toolchain** you want to use (e.g., GCC).
5. **Configure the project settings** under "Project Properties" > "C/C++ Build" > "Settings."

### 5. **Visual Studio Code**

1. **Open Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Install the C/C++ extension** from Microsoft if you haven't already.
3. **Create a `tasks.json` file** in the `.vscode` folder to set up build tasks:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "2.0.0",
       "tasks": [
           {
               "label": "build C",
               "type": "shell",
               "command": "gcc",
               "args": [
                   "-o",
                   "my_program",
                   "my_program.c"
               ],
               "group": {
                   "kind": "build",
                   "isDefault": true
               }
           },
           {
               "label": "build C++",
               "type": "shell",
               "command": "g++",
               "args": [
                   "-o",
                   "my_program",
                   "my_program.cpp"
               ],
               "group": {
                   "kind": "build",
                   "isDefault": true
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
4. **Run the build task** using `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

### 6. **Makefile**

If you are using a Makefile for your project, you can specify the compiler like this:

```makefile
CC=gcc
CXX=g++
CFLAGS=-Wall -g
CXXFLAGS=-Wall -g

all: my_program

my_program: my_program.o
    $(CC) -o my_program my_program.o

my_program.o: my_program.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c my_program.c

clean:
    rm -f my_program my_program.o
```

### Conclusion

Choose the method that corresponds to your development environment. 
Ensure that you have the appropriate compilers installed (like GCC for C/C++), and follow the steps to set them up for your project.
